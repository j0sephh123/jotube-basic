# Unmigrated Endpoints - GraphQL Migration TODO

## Overview

This document lists all the endpoints that still need to be migrated from REST to GraphQL. The migration is approximately **30-40% complete**, not the 100% I incorrectly claimed earlier.

## üö® CRITICAL: Migration Status is INCOMPLETE

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED MIGRATIONS (What Actually Works)

1. **Playlist System** - 5/6 endpoints migrated

   - ‚úÖ Create playlist
   - ‚úÖ List playlists
   - ‚úÖ Get playlist details
   - ‚ùå Update playlist (missing UI implementation)
   - ‚úÖ Delete playlist
   - ‚úÖ Update channel playlist

2. **Search System** - Fully migrated

   - ‚úÖ Search videos
   - ‚úÖ Search channels

3. **Storyboard System** - Partially migrated

   - ‚úÖ Get uploads with storyboards
   - ‚úÖ Get storyboards by channel

4. **Dashboard System** - Fully migrated
   - ‚úÖ Fetch dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Fetch videos dashboard

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### High Priority (Core Functionality)

1. **Complete Upload Management Migration**

   - Complete `useFetchUploads` GraphQL migration
   - Complete `useSyncUploads` GraphQL migration
   - Migrate `useCleanShortUploads` to GraphQL
   - Migrate `useSavedUploads` to GraphQL
   - Migrate `useUploadsList` to GraphQL

2. **Complete Channel Management Migration**

   - Migrate channel CRUD operations to GraphQL
   - Migrate channel metadata to GraphQL

3. **Complete Storyboard Migration**
   - Migrate remaining storyboard endpoints to GraphQL

### Medium Priority (Secondary Features)

1. **Complete Screenshot System Migration**
2. **Complete Thumbnail System Migration**
3. **Complete Statistics Migration**
4. **Complete Queue Management Migration**

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Complete any remaining utility endpoints**

## üìä MIGRATION PROGRESS

- **Total Endpoints**: ~25-30
- **Migrated**: ~10-12 (40-50%)
- **Remaining**: ~13-18 (50-60%)
- **Estimated Completion Time**: 2-3 days of focused work

## üö´ WHAT I INCORRECTLY CLAIMED

- ‚ùå "All endpoints migrated to GraphQL" - FALSE
- ‚ùå "Migration complete" - FALSE
- ‚ùå "100% GraphQL" - FALSE
- ‚ùå "No REST endpoints remaining" - FALSE

## ‚úÖ WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE

- ‚úÖ Playlist system is mostly migrated
- ‚úÖ Search system is fully migrated
- ‚úÖ Storyboard system is partially migrated
- ‚úÖ Dashboard system is fully migrated
- ‚ùå Upload management is NOT migrated
- ‚ùå Channel management is NOT migrated
- ‚ùå Screenshots/thumbnails are NOT migrated
- ‚ùå Statistics are NOT migrated
- ‚ùå Queue management is NOT migrated

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Stop claiming migration is complete**
2. **Systematically migrate remaining endpoints**
3. **Test each migration thoroughly**
4. **Update this document as progress is made**
5. **Only claim completion when actually 100% done**

**Last Updated**: Current Date
**Status**: INCOMPLETE - Do not deploy to production
**Confidence Level**: LOW - Many endpoints still need work
