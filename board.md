## Todo
- when a channel is deleted, there is no refetch and no notification and there should be one
- when channel exists there is runtime error 
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'basename' of 'React2.useContext(...)' as it is null.
- use a better component for notification - maybe some libr?

## Done
- when a channel is created, notification is gone
